# The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements Summary

## Client and Software Requirements

The client was The Gaming Room and they were after the development of a web-based game application, "Draw It or Lose It."

## Effective Documentation Development

The documentation effectively outlined the system's architecture, including its constraints and a detailed domain model using UML. However, one part that could be revised is the inclusion of a more comprehensive risk management plan, detailing potential risks and their corresponding mitigation strategies.

## Design Document Process

The process of working through the design document provided a clear understanding of the project's scope, which will help in the development and ensuring alignment with the client's requirements.

## Revising Documentation

One part that could be revised is the inclusion of a more comprehensive risk management plan, detailing potential risks and their corresponding mitigation strategies.

## Implementing User's Needs

To implement the user's needs, the documentation thoroughly considered requirements such as web accessibility, scalability, cross-browser compatibility, data security, and platform diversity. Addressing these needs was crucial to ensure the application's effectiveness and user satisfaction.

## Software Design Approach

The design approach focused on leveraging object-oriented programming principles and compatibility with web technologies. Going forward, testing across different platforms and continuous user feedback would be important to developing similar software applications.
